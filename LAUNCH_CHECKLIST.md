```

**Required for launch:**
```
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...          # Claude API key
VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_ID=your-store.myshopify.com

   - Carbon fiber decals
   - Custom bike parts
3. Products auto-sync to Shopify

**In Shopify:**
1. Verify products synced from Printify
2. Add product images and detailed descriptions
3. Set pricing (Printify adds base cost, you set markup)
4. Publish products

### Step 3: Test Everything Locally

4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_...
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up Domain & SSL

# Netlify automatically deploys
# Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
```
